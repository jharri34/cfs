Identifying a marker may ultimately help us understand the mechanism of these illnesses and thus develop better treatments. This has never been looked at before. In order to answer this question, we will need to collect blood samples and see how that relates to your symptoms. The study would involve coming to University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). You will be compensated for your time. Thank you for your interest in our research.</p> </div> <div class="image2"></div> <div class="section container"> <h3>What to do if you are interested in participating?</h3> <p>If you are interested in participating in this research study your first step is to complete the following online questionnaire: </p> <br> <strong>The survey will time out after 30 continuous minutes of inactivity.</strong> <br> <br> <a href="#"> LINK TO QUALTRICS QUESTIONNAIRE HERE </a> <br> <br> <p>Please understand that there will be a short waiting period between you completing the questionnaire and our staff contacting you. </p> <br> <strong>If you have already completed the online questionnaire what happens next…. </strong> <br> <p>After you have completed the questionnaire, our research staff will contact you via your preferred method ( phone or email) to speak with you about your eligibility.</p> <br> <br> </div> <div class="image3"></div> <div class="map section container"> <h3>Directions for your visit:</h3> <input id="input" class="controls" type="text" placeholder="Search Box"> <div id="map-canvas"></div> <div id="directions-panel"></div> </div> <div class="lost section container"> <h3>What to do if you are lost:</h3> <p>If you are lost while traveling to your visit: Call Kate 1-256-600-1662 , if she does not answer the phone, please feel free to contact UAB’s Radio Paging at 205-934-3411 and as to page: 7087 or Kate Wesson Sides.</p> <p> If you are confused by the directions above and have questions, call Kate before you travel.</p> <p>If there is no answer you can also call, 205-934 -7817.

He then completed postdoctoral fellowships at Arizona State University and the Stanford University School of Medicine before taking an assistant professor position at Stanford. In 2014, he joined the faculty at the University of Alabama Birmingham, with a primary appointment in the Department of Psychology and secondary appointments in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Rheumatology. Prof. Younger's goal is to end the chronic pain and fatigue that is caused by inflammation in the brain. He is currently funded by the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, and several non-profit agencies to develop techniques for diagnosing and treating neuroinflammation, pain, and fatigue. </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
